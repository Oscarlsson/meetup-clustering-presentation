Clustering meetup presentation
=======

This is the notes, presentations and code used at my presentation at the Machine Learning Gothenburg event
the 5th of February 2015.

Link to the event: http://www.meetup.com/Goteborg-Machine-Learning-Meetup/events/220086252/


## What will you find in this repository?
Besides spelling error you will find
* Theoretical introduction to clustering and feature engineering
* A demo introduction to data (mining) analysis in Python
* A lyrics-crawler

Both presentations are ipython notebook and to convert them to slides you run
`./run_theoryslide` or `./run_demoslide` depending on which presentation you want.
If you want the speakers note to work you need to download `reveal.js` and store it in this direction.
The run-script assumes it is in `reveal.js/` but will fallback on CDN if it is not found.
